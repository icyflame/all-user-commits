# all-user-commits

> See the commit hashes of every commit has ever pushed to GitHub

**Unfinished** I am still working to get this repository to full functionality.

### Why?

Often, you have a commit hash, and you paste it inside a GH issue, and GH does not automatically link it.

That simply means that that commit hash is not on the same repository as the issue itself.

So, how do you find out which repository it is from?

This repository can help you out!

### How?

Go to [this repo's page](http://icyflame.github.io/all-user-commits/) and enter your GitHub username
and press submit. This repository will make some requests to the GitHub API and get all of your commits.
